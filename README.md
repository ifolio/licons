# Licons
Light and clean svg icons.
Licons is currently in beta version, no script only svg files, the idea is to create a script that automatically replaces `<i>` tags with `<svg>` from the icon files as follows:

# Sample Usage
1. Include the javascript file, or you can use the cdn.

```html
<script src="/path/js/licons.js"></script>
<-- or use the cdn -->
<script src="https://cdn.cdn/path/js/licons.js"></script>
```

2. Use the `<i>` tag to use the icon.

```html
<i class="licons licons-paper"></i>
```

3. Call the javascript function.

```javascript
$(".licons").Licons();
```
